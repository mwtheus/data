[Are You Stuck in the Anxiety-Distraction Feedback Loop?](https://hbr.org/2020/05/are-you-stuck-in-the-anxiety-distraction-feedback-loop), 
we can have a better understanding of something.

Specifically, it talks about why we crave for distractions (Instagram, YouTube)
instead of doing what we really have to do. That's important and it happens to 
me often. For example, right now I am feeling anxious, and I have a really 
important job to finish, but I can't focus on it. Not because I don't want to, 
but maybe because I **physically** can't.

You see, I feel a really awful feeling in my stomach, and my brain is simply
numb. It is not that I don't know how to do my work or don't know what to do... 
I am simply anxious, and it is preventing me from doing things. But it is not
preventing me from wanting to lurk YouTube or Reddit.

That's how addictive those things can be. The algorithms, the suggestions,
teachs our brain that these are sources of dopamine, and by seeing them, it 
kinda feels like we are doing something important - even though we are not.

And here, the trick is exactly this: anxiety **is not** bad. It is good. It is 
a response from our brain, showing that something is wrong, we just need to 
redirect it to the right place: away from the stomach and into the brain. Then 
we can learn that the immediate reward is not really a reward - most of the 
times.

The article states that perfectly:

> learned to associate a particular action with an outcome. Anyone who gets an

> bored or anxious can relate to this this feeling. That restless contraction in 
> your stomach or chest. It lets you know that something is off. Your brain says 
> 'do something!' and the action, or the distraction, makes you feel better. To 
> you, looking at cute puppies on YouTube (again) may seem like a strange choice 
> when you still have a big project to do. But to your brain, itâ€™s a no-brainer. 
> Its survival 101.

Also, I know my triggers, and I need to avoid them. Finishing the job is the way
to acheive this, but it still can put it on the side, because it's easier to go
numb. This is really bad, because it teaches something. And even if the lesson
is bad, the brain can't know. And the results may only show later.
