So, on December 23, 2020, I start my first Algorithmic Trading project, and I
completely feel in love with it. Not just because it promises passive income,
but also because it is a very interesting field! To be able to work with stocks
and trading is simply awesome, and joining Computer Science with it makes it
even more attractive.

This project uses the [Binary.com API](https://developers.binary.com/) 
and has a good strategy that my clients have reached after months of research 
and attemps. I finished the first version on Febrary 13, 2021, and it should 
supposedly have made me some money. It is awesome! I still need to learn a lot 
more about Binary Options, though.
