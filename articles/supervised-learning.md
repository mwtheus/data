# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is the act of feeding the model with some data for it to
predict the label for each entry. The classic exemple of the flowers expresses
it well. Based on size and color of a flower, can the model predict what the 
flower type is?

This implies that the model must have tons of data, since it have to decide
based on a given set of information.  With supervised learning we can measure
the accuracy of the model based on the real values and the models predictions.
